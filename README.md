# Game Network Copier
A little tool that allows users to copy their games over the local network.
## Motivation
If you have a slow connection to the internet like me, you only have patience to wait for one computer to download your game. One could argue that using an USB external storage you would have this problem solved, but sometimes having a solution that works over the network, using your local network full speed, is easier and pratical.<br>
Plus, if a friend is coming over, you can transfer a game to him using this tool.
## Current State
It only creates a FTP server to the Steam default library for testing purposes, however some addicional code is implemented in order to add adicional features.
You can test it using a tradicional FTP Client such as [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org).
## Support
Right now, I'm only considering Steam. Other platforms should be easy to integrate, but since this project is done on my spare time and I cannot compromise to it fully. New platforms and features will be announced through a tbd channel.
